# Fine-Tuned BERT Model for Paraphrase Detection

### Model Description
This is a fine-tuned version of **BERT-base** for **paraphrase detection**, trained on four benchmark datasets: **MRPC, QQP, PAWS-X, and PIT**. The model is designed for applications such as **duplicate content detection, question answering, and semantic similarity analysis**. It offers strong recall capabilities, making it effective in identifying paraphrases even in complex sentence structures.

- **Developed by:** Viswadarshan R R  
- **Model Type:** Transformer-based Sentence Pair Classifier  
- **Language:** English  
- **Finetuned from:** `bert-base-cased`

### Model Sources

- **Repository:** [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/viswadarshan06/pd-bert/)  
- **Research Paper:** _Comparative Insights into Modern Architectures for Paraphrase Detection_ (Accepted at ICCIDS 2025)  
- **Demo:** (To be added upon deployment)  

## Uses

### Direct Use
- Identifying **duplicate questions** in customer support and FAQs.  
- Improving **semantic search** in retrieval-based systems.  
- Enhancing **document deduplication** and text similarity applications.  

### Downstream Use
This model can be further fine-tuned on domain-specific paraphrase datasets for industries such as **healthcare, legal, and finance**.

### Out-of-Scope Use
- The model is **monolingual** and trained only on **English datasets**, requiring additional fine-tuning for multilingual tasks.  
- May struggle with **idiomatic expressions** or complex figurative language.  

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Known Limitations
- **Higher recall but lower precision**: The model tends to over-identify paraphrases, leading to increased false positives.  
- **Contextual ambiguity**: May misinterpret sentences that require deep contextual reasoning.  

### Recommendations
Users can mitigate the **false positive rate** by applying post-processing techniques or confidence threshold tuning.  

## How to Get Started with the Model

To use the model, install **transformers** and load the fine-tuned model as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_path = "viswadarshan06/pd-bert"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Encode sentence pairs
inputs = tokenizer("The car is fast.", "The vehicle moves quickly.", return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Get predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits
predicted_class = logits.argmax().item()
print("Paraphrase" if predicted_class == 1 else "Not a Paraphrase")
```
